			The Safari updates enabled smart invert. When your screen is in inverted mode
			the images and video the web pages are "inverted twice" to force them into normal
			colors. Usually this is desirable but sometimes the images or videos are mostly
			text, therefore we need them to stay inverted.
		</p>
		<p>
			Introducing See Better Smart Invert Safari Extension. You can toggle how this
			this works between smart invert and classic invert. In classic invert, it
			works like it always did before. You can control it separately for images
			and videos.
		</p>
		<p>
			After installing the extension, open Safari Preferences and go to the Extensions
			at top. See Better Smart Invert will be on the left side, select that
			and you can change the modes there.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are some web pages where this does not work yet. One I have found are
			pages that have twitter images embedded. They are always smart invert regardless
			the setting in your SEe Better Smart Invert.
